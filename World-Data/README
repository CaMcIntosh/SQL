# World Data Exploration

SQL analysis of country-level demographic datasets to examine global population dynamics, fertility, age distribution, and migration patterns.

## Dataset Description

Fields used in this dataset include:

- country — country name
- region — geographic classification
- population — total population
- population_growth — annual growth rate (percentage)
- fertility_rate — births per woman
- median_age — median age of population
- net_migration — net migration rate

Regions include Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania.

## Analysis Objectives

Sample analytical questions explored:

- Which regions have the youngest versus oldest population structures?
- How do fertility rates vary across regions and income levels?
- Which countries exhibit high population growth compared to global averages?
- How does net migration correlate with demographic factors?
- What regions display overall population concentration?

## SQL Concepts Demonstrated

This project includes:

- ORDER BY sorting
- WHERE filtering
- CASE expressions for demographic categorization
- GROUP BY with aggregation
- HAVING for filtered summaries
- Calculated fields for rate comparisons

## Example Insights

From the queries, we observe patterns such as:

- Africa and parts of Asia having higher fertility and growth rates.
- Europe and Oceania presenting older median ages and lower fertility.
- Net migration trends differing sharply across regions and income groups.
- Regional aggregation highlighting demographic concentration and diversity.

## Tools Used

- SQL (SQLite-style syntax)

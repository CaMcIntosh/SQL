# Customer Order & Sales Analytics

SQL analysis of retail order and customer data to examine sales performance, product demand, customer purchasing behavior, and revenue trends across multiple months.

## Dataset Description

This project analyzes transactional sales data from January through May, along with customer account mappings.

Key tables include:

### Sales Tables
- **JanSales, FebSales, MarSales, AprSales, MaySales**
  - `orderID` — unique order identifier  
  - `product` — product name  
  - `quantity` — number of units ordered  
  - `price` — unit price of the product  
  - `orderdate` — date of the order  
  - `location` — order fulfillment location  

### Customer Table
- **customers**
  - `order_id` — order identifier  
  - `acctnum` — customer account number  

The data includes multiple products per order and repeated purchases across different customers and locations.

## Analysis Objectives

The analysis focuses on answering business-oriented questions such as:

- How many unique orders were placed in a given month?
- Which products were most frequently purchased?
- What was the total revenue generated by each product?
- Which products were sold at specific locations?
- How many customers placed higher-volume orders?
- What was the average spend for customers ordering multiple items?

These questions reflect common retail and e-commerce analytics use cases.

## SQL Techniques Applied

This project demonstrates the use of:

- `DISTINCT` counts for unique order analysis  
- `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` between sales and customer tables  
- `GROUP BY` with aggregation (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`)  
- `HAVING` clauses for post-aggregation filtering  
- Calculated fields for revenue and spend metrics  
- Data cleansing filters to remove header rows and invalid records  
- `ORDER BY` for sorted analytical outputs  

## Example Insights

From the analysis, we observe patterns such as:

- A limited number of products accounting for the majority of monthly revenue.
- Certain locations driving concentrated sales activity.
- Higher-quantity orders being placed by a smaller subset of customers.
- Revenue differences driven by both product price and purchase volume.
- Clear distinctions between order-level and customer-level spending behavior.
